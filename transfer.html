<div  id='write'  class = 'is-mac'><h1><a name='header-c5' class='md-header-anchor '></a>An Exhaustive Guide for Transfer Admission (IIT Bombay) (Rough First Draft)</h1><h4><a name='header-c7' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Preface</h4><p>If you think IIT Bombay might be missing something vital for you, and if you are a freshie or a sophie, then take the plunge. Apply to study at the best universities in the world, because even if you fail, nothing is lost. This guide is here to facilitate you in your attempt to pursue a better college experience.</p><p>While I was in IIT Bombay applying for transfer, I was blown away by the fact that every year only one or two (out of ~2000 freshies and sophies) apply for transfer. </p><p>IIT Bombay isn&#39;t perfect. How could it be that very few consider transferring and out of those only 1/2 even take the pains of applying?</p><p>The answer I quickly learned was quite plain - people simply didn&#39;t know that this was an option. </p><p>The opportunity wasn&#39;t popularized at all. Interestingly, all the previous IIT Bombay transfers that I know of are AIR 1s or AIR 2s; all of whom went on to study at MIT. I sensed that there are false conceptions surrounding this already forsaken idea of transfer.</p><p>Who am I then, to tell you what this process is and why you should try it out?</p><p>I am an IIT Bombay student who applied for transfer in 2017 and was luckily accepted into Columbia University. Since almost all IIT Bombay students don&#39;t know of Columbia, let me explain. It is a college situated in Manhattan, New York City and is considered to be one of the top 10 US colleges [ TIMES, US News &#39;17 ]. I will begin my studies in Columbia in the month of September. After that experience, I hope to add further nuance to my answers mentioned here.&#39;</p><p>So without further ado, let&#39;s get into the complicated mess of applying for transfer in IIT Bombay.&#39;</p><hr /><h4><a name='header-c25' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Index</h4><p>This guide is not meant to be read in a single sitting.</p><p>I have divided it into multiple modules. Read the ones you require, given your interest.</p><p><strong>Part 1</strong>: What is it like applying? <strong>The Cost of Transfer</strong></p><p><strong>Part 2</strong>: What do you send? <strong>The Transfer Application</strong></p><p><strong>Part 3</strong>: <strong>What does it take</strong> to Transfer?</p><p><strong>Part 4</strong>: How do I this, transfer? <strong>The Transfer Application Timeline</strong></p><p><strong>Part 5</strong>: Why leave IIT Bombay? <strong>My Experience with Transfer Application</strong></p><p><em>Note</em>: If you are not interested in transfer, you can skip Part 1-4.</p><p><em>Disclaimer</em> </p><ol start='' ><li>I love IIT Bombay, and am not some miser who hates everything. I have formed close friendships and met with wonderful people; all of which I cherish. </li><li>While I can&#39;t explain, within the limits of this guide, why US universities are better than IIT Bombay in various regards, I still hope to write an article demystifying this Indian misconception soon.&#39;</li></ol><hr /><h4><a name='header-c52' class='md-header-anchor '></a>The Cost of Transfer</h4><p>Now before I enter the technicalities of transfer admission, first thing I need to clear is that you have to have an extremely strong reason for transfer. The three main reasons are:</p><ol start='' ><li><p>Transfer is mentally and emotionally taxing. </p><p>IIT Bombay has enough opportunities that you can leverage for growth in multiple spheres. Only after you firmly believe that your growth in a certain direction is being limited by the college, would I recommend that you even start thinking about transfer.</p><p>Thinking about transfer admission is a heavy load on the mind and heart. It will push you to recognize what you actually value about the institute. Then, it will push you to actively reject the lovable nature of IIT. There is the more extreme cost of leaving your friends.</p><p>Transfer is also ultimately highly improbable.</p><p>Know what you are losing so that you can appreciate what you are working for.</p></li><li><p>Transfer is extra tough for students who need financial aid.</p><p>Other than Harvard, Yale and MIT, every other college considers transfer students need for financial aid (also known as &quot;scholarship&quot; amongst Indians; a misnomer). It will cost you <strong>a hefty 1 - 1.5 crore</strong> for 3 years if you go to any other college. Considering the chances of getting into those 3 colleges, it is safe to assume that transfer is an extremely costly affair.</p><p><strong>Important Note:</strong> If finances is the only thing stopping you, only apply to Harvard, Yale and MIT. Many AIR 1 and AIR 2 students have transferred to MIT in the past because they wanted to study in a world class university and saved on finances.</p></li><li><p>Transfer application takes time, hence pushes on academics and extracurricular activities.</p><p>During the month of February, all I did was go to classes and work on my application. It was stressful to manage midsems alongside the applications. ( This is actually because I procrastinated on my application till it was almost impossible to apply. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ I wasn&#39;t sure about it till the end.&#39;) I managed to perform well in my midsems because I paid extra attention in lectures to make up for lost mugging time. Otherwise, it is a risky affair academically.</p></li></ol><hr /><h4><a name='header-c80' class='md-header-anchor '></a>The Transfer Application</h4><p>Transfer application can be broken down into</p><ul><li><p>Essays</p><p>The <strong>most important</strong> part of your application.</p><p>The heart and soul of your application.</p><p>In the essays, you get to convey your reasons for transfer. You get to communicate what you best love about a particular college.</p><p>Essay writing for applications is a niche skill. You have to be authentic in your writing. It will take you multiple tries before you think you have anything which might be worth reading. The main advice I can give is: show, don&#39;t tell, and keep it honest.</p></li><li><p>CPI</p><p>If you are anywhere above 8.5 CPI or 9, you should be fine. Anything below and your chances might nearly be nil. ( To be honest, even if you are a 9 pointer, your chances might be nearly nil. )</p></li><li><p>Transcripts</p><p>College and High School transcripts must be delivered by post from your 10th-12th schools and IIT. High school marks don&#39;t matter too much, so don&#39;t worry if you haven&#39;t done well in your boards.</p></li><li><p>Recommendations</p><p>This is the <strong>second most important</strong> part of your application after essays.</p><p>Recommendations offer a third person point of view on the applicant. The admission committee gets to see how you are perceived by others. They want to measure your dedication, your involvement in class and any signs of excellence they are seeking. Most colleges have a personality, and they seek students which fit into their own personality. Recommendations offer a genuine view on your personality.</p></li><li><p>College Report</p><p>A minor form that needs to be filled by your department HoD, and posted by them. ( Can also be sent by scan )</p></li><li><p>Extracurriculars</p><p>Almost as important as your CPI.</p><p>This is your way of showing what you are going to do once you get to their college. Extracurriculars are irrelevant if you have not demonstrated through competitions or portfolios, that you have some level of excellence in that activity.</p></li><li><p>ACT with Writing / SAT</p><p>Many people think this is a big deal, but it is probably the most useless part of your application. This is the standardized examination you have to take. A huge misconception amongst Indians is to think that just like JEE, your score on SAT/ACT will determine your college. This is not true at all. Even if you get full in every test you have given in your life, you might not get into any top college at all. American college applications are weird.</p><p>It is a tokenistic necessity for a few colleges.</p></li></ul><hr /><h4><a name='header-c132' class='md-header-anchor '></a>What It Takes to Transfer</h4><p>Transfer applicants are college students.</p><p>The first ( and second, if a sophie is reading ) year showcases, in a more concrete way, what a particular student has to offer.</p><p>For the application committee, the three questions that are clear are:</p><ol start='' ><li>Can you perform well academically?</li><li>What do you do outside class and how well?</li></ol><p>The third instrumental question: Why transfer?</p><p>For Q1 and Q2, they see your CPI, extracurricular achievements or extracurriculars in general.</p><p>For Q3, if they see that you have a strong reason to transfer to that college in particular, then you are most probably in.</p><p>Adcoms (admission committee) accept students who know what they want to do, to come to their college and use their resources to the fullest extent.</p><p>You can only realize the gaps of your original college if you have a goal/strategy.</p><p>On a concrete level what does this mean:</p><ol start='' ><li>Keep your GPA up top.</li><li>Spend your first semester rigorously exploring. Go to competitions, events, get good. (I danced, debated, acted, rapped, went to the US for MHacks, wrote, and explored the institute.)
If you are a sophie, then winning any sort of competition in your area of interest works.</li><li>Spend your first year fiercely figuring out what you want to get good at, and why.</li></ol><p>Final note:</p><p>Transfer is nearly impossible. Never ask anyone what you are chances are, because they will always be almost nil. I was often disheartened by this. However, I felt somewhere inside that if I persevered hard enough and cast a wide enough net ( applied to 10 colleges ), then I&#39;d be able to land at least one college. Luckily I did. </p><p>American college applications are so dependent on luck, it drives me crazy.</p><hr /><h4><a name='header-c176' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Transfer Application Timeline</h4><p><strong>Prerequisite Conditions</strong></p><ol start='' ><li>Reason for transferring is solid </li><li>Sufficient family support acquired</li><li>College list is decided;</li></ol><p><strong>Timeline Overview</strong></p><p>First Semester</p><ul><li>Set up the application</li><li>Take the standardized test: ACT with Writing / SAT</li><li>Interact with professors and TAs during the semester.

This early enthusiasm was brought on by the nagging question of &quot;what does college mean to me?&quot; A bug in my mind, put there by life-changing experience that was: The Cathedral and John Connon School.</p><p>The Cathedral and John Connon School was the ultimate bubble. The students spoke purely in English. The academics was seriously considered not to be everything. The school cared about life values. Most unbelievably, the students were disconnected from the reality of JEE in India. Only a dozen students in my year had remotely planned to give the exam, while everyone else was vaguely planning to study in the US. Rest assured, after leaving the place, I learned that Cathedral is an exception amongst exceptions in the Indian school system.</p><p>Despite all this, Cathedral didn&#39;t convince me that US universities are a better place to study. </p><p>What it did was, leave me with the question: <strong>what is an education, and what do you need it for?</strong></p><p>For the first time in my life, I began thinking about the waves which pushed my life ahead. My premature love for philosophy began to emerge at this point.</p><hr /><p>The most remarkable thing about my life is my luck.</p><p>In Moscow, there was not a single school with a seat for a 3rd grader. Half a year later, Kendriya Vidyalaya agrees to let me sit in for the 4th grade admission test.</p><p>In Mumbai, Cathedral was notorious for having zero vacancies. Luckily before I came, a student ( named Dhruva ) had left, freeing up a seat for me.</p><p>After Cathedral, I had sit in for an astronomy olympiad test to pass time. In a huge stroke of luck, I ended up clearing the level to reach the top 30 astronomy camp, with 0.5 marks margin above the cutoff. Then, failed to get chosen for the Indian team that year. Tried again, got to the top 30, but this time, I was one of the only 5 camp repeaters. Here, again, luckily there were less repeaters than the team number count. Got chosen to represent my country!</p><p>It was at the International Olympiad of Astronomy and Astrophysics that I finally decided that I wanted to study in the US colleges. All other team participants were applying to US colleges, except the Indian team. Met with this peculiar discovery, I decided to subvert some of my focus from JEE to applying to the US. Lo and behold, I did a sloppy job and ended up being rejected from the 6 colleges I applied. Despite of the bleak outcome, I had learnt too much about the American education system, and my mind was riddled with another question — <strong>what do I want to study in college?</strong> </p><p>A question IIT Bombay was not equipped to answer.</p><hr /><p>The most confusing question I get is — why did you transfer out of IIT Bombay?</p><p>There&#39;s a lot to the answer. It would require at least an hour to get the answer started. Various opinions, beliefs and notions which I have gained will be examined one by one. The real answer is that it seemed to fit perfectly with the way I had lived till date. The practical answer is as follows.</p><p>For the sake of this guide brevity, I will list them out. Further clarification will be provided if requested.</p><ol start='' ><li><p>IIT Bombay&#39;s education lacks a human aspect which I needed for looking at the world in different ways, more humane ways at least.</p><ul><li><p>What do I mean by &quot;human aspect&quot;?</p><p>When the world stamps you with guarantee of being an adult when you turn 18, the onus is then on you to understand the people in this world, how their opinions/values are formed, and how they clash. At the end of the day, we are living in an incredibly globalized world. Passing through our learning phase without actually making the effort to understand the rest of the world seems rather nonsensical. </p><p>What do I specifically mean by this?</p><p>Even if IIT Bombay, gives students the opportunity to take up humanities courses, one as a requirement and rest as electives, the people in the institute don&#39;t discuss this vital part of the education. Real learning happens outside the classroom in heated conversations with friends. The IIT Bombay Debating Society is the only such community I found in my first year, which discussed these ideas, not in a casual setting however, but that&#39;s not a problem. Again, there are a huge number of communities in IIT Bombay that I haven&#39;t interacted with, so please forgive my passing generalizations.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I wanted to study CS, physics and philosophy. I didn&#39;t want to do something against my own wishes.</p><ul><li><p>Branch Change should be a right.</p><p>It is frankly inhumane and sad that students in India don&#39;t have the liberty of choosing their major. While it is understandable that a college major doesn&#39;t piegonhole you out of other possibilities, but if there are people who know that they want to study X subject, then they should be allowed to do so with full liberty and experienced supervision. </p><p>India&#39;s college system has a long way to go. The Indian craze after CS and anything monetary is not stupid, just shortsighted and a product of our culture. However, it is unfairly blocking people who genuinely want to study these high demand majors. Finding students who have at least some idea of what they like is rare. But rather than being awarded, they are punished if they don&#39;t perform academically well enough, and forced to study something they don&#39;t prefer. </p><p>Two paragraphs won&#39;t do justice to this incredibly complicated issue, but the basic idea is that if you love something, you should be able to chase it with all your energies.</p></li><li><p>I wasn&#39;t planning on putting up with this shit.</p><p>I have wanted to study CS and physics for a long time. </p><p>My CPI was above 9, but pinning hopes on branch change seemed like a lost cause. CPI is way too sensitive to luck in your first year. It felt completely arbitrary by the end of my freshman year, and almost out of my control.</p><p>Freshman year was all about distilling my focuses down to 3 pursuits. By the end, however, it remained at: coding, debating, writing, studying. Being able to merge coding and studying into one pursuit would have been spectacular for me. So this was another incentive for transfer application.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Life in IITB is too relaxed. The academics aren&#39;t too stressful ( except in CS and Elec ). And people actually while away their time doing nothing. While this gives a lot of time to have great conversations, it often causes people to fall into the trap of repeating the same verbal exchanges and memes.</p><ul><li><p>Free time</p><p>I would hear from my friends studying in the US about the culture of &quot;work hard, play hard.&quot; American college students would study a 1000 times more than IITB students, and would party 1000 times harder than us. ( Sidenote: There are no actual parties in IIT Bombay. )</p><p>That fascinated me. They were living on the brink. Meanwhile, we here were just whiling our time away in some empty way.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I knew that I had to try aiming higher. US universities are overall much better than IIT Bombay.</p><ul><li><p>College was never an end goal. </p><p>College was about creating meaningful life experiences I would cherish for long.</p><p>Life will take care of itself if I did college right.</p><p>These were my two beliefs I held firmly the whole time.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p>Now, look. </p><p>These reasons weren&#39;t clear to me while I was applying. I&#39;d say only reason 1 and 2 were the ones I pitched to colleges in my application. Transfer made me continually articulate what college is, what does it mean to me, what do I want from life, what went wrong with the system, which is the best mindset to view IIT Bombay with, and many other such questions. The gruelling process facilitated by my experience as a member of the IIT Bombay Debating Society helped me gain nuance in my thinking. Something I will forever be grateful for.</p><p>In the end, I still love IIT Bombay a lot. I tried so hard to convince myself not to apply, but I had a friend who always kept reminding me of the reasons I considered it in the first place. Even though, it is an expensive affair, and it might not give the payoffs I expected, I am glad that I did something about it, instead of nothing at all. Life is empowering when you make your own choices and stick with them.</p><p>This long fundae session has finally come to its end. </p><p>With that, I&#39;d like to say, best of luck for transfer. It will change you. Even if you fail, you will be grateful that you tried.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>
